i would like to create bettory limiter how would like                                                                                                                              3499
Sure, here is a general idea of how a battery limiter CLI tool can be developed. Please note that this is a high-level project idea, and developing such a tool requires significant knowledge and development experience.

1. Define the requirements: Start by defining the requirements and features for the battery limiter CLI tool. Some essential functionalities could include setting battery thresholds, displaying the remaining battery power, providing alerts when the battery is low, and shutting down the system if necessary.

2. Choose the programming language and CLI frameworks: Choose the most appropriate programming language depending on your expertise and available resources. You could use Python, Bash, or any other language that supports CLI applications. Once finalized, select an appropriate CLI framework like Click, Typer, or argparse to parse command-line arguments and build interactive CLI applications.

3. Collecting system information: Collecting system information, such as the battery status, power consumption, and charging status, can be done using system log files and command-line tools such as acpi and upower. Use the programming language to execute these command-line tools.

4. Setting the threshold and customizing alerts: Using CLI tools, you can set the battery threshold and customize alerts when the battery is low. For example, you can play a sound, display a notification, or send an email alert.

5. Implement battery shutdown feature: Developing a battery shutdown feature will involve setting up a listener that waits for a low battery event and initiates the shutdown process with a few CLI commands.

6. Testing and debug: After completing the development process, the tool should be thoroughly tested and debugged to ensure that it works as expected. You could either create unit testsor test the tool manually.

7. Publishing the tool: After testing the tool, create a packaging system suitable for the target platform, such as Debian package or RPM package, and publish it on relevant software repositories or distribution channels.

This is a high-level overview of how one can develop a battery limiter CLI tool. This project is an excellent opportunity to learn how to work with system-level programming, advanced CLI functionality, and writing software that interacts with hardware.
